# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction


# About
## Prediction of the outcome of the first stage landing for future rocket launches using Machine Learning

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
