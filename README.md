# About
I conducted this case study as a final project in the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). The uploaded presentation gives a detailed insight into the process from data collection to model evaluation, as well as the used tools to complete the study.
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
